THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

It should be rewritten to fit into the CGAL framework at some time.

However for now it does seem to work and with the following todos
implemeted it ought to be able to output polygons as CCW and CW lists
of points

1. utilize normal vector from STL to determine start and end point of segment

2. sticth together segments
An important note is that points really ought to be exactly the same place, 
the intersection points should be calculated from the same vertices, albeit twice.
