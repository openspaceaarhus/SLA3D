Sierpinski Tetrahedron STL Generator

Small Java program to generate a fractal shape to a STL file. 

How to use:

Double click on sierpinski.jar in Explorer/Finder 
or type in a shell: java -jar sierpinski.jar 

If started with no parameters, it will generate a Sierpinski Tetrahedron from level 0 (plain tetrahedron) to level 6, in 7 different files.

If started with an argument, like

java -jar sierpinski.jar 10

it will generate a tetrahedron fractal of level 10, which is very huge.

Feel free to improve and add more fractal shapes.
