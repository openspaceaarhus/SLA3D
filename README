This is the git repository where all the source files and documentation
for OSAAs LASER 3D printer project is housed.

There are some wiki pages available here with more info:
https://github.com/dren-dk/OSAA.LASER/wiki/Overview

Please contact Flemming Frandsen for commit access to the main repository.

Please use only lower case file and directory names, unless the file contains a Java class.

Please do not use any funny characters in files names,
so a-z, 0-9, . and - are ok, while space, \, /, _ and : are not.
